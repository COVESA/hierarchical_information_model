A `type_definition` tree contains data type definitions that are not part of the
[primitive datatypes](/hierarchical_information_model/common_rule_set/data_entry/datatypes#primitive-datatypes) defined by HIM.

The currently supported node types are suited for definition of [structs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_data_type).

## Node Types

The node types for representing type definitions are:
- Branch
- Struct
- Property

Please see more information about these node types [here](/hierarchical_information_model/common_rule_set/node_types/).
