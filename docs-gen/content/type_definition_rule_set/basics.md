A `type_definition` tree contains data type definitions.
These can either be complex datatypes that are not part of the
[primitive datatypes](/hierarchical_information_model/common_rule_set/data_entry/datatypes#primitive-datatypes) defined by HIM,
or it can be common allowed definitions.

## Node Types
The currently supported node types can be used for either the definition of [structs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_data_type),
or for the definition of [allowed](/hierarchical_information_model/common_rule_set/data_entry/value_restrictions/#allowed) value restrictions.

The node types for representing type definitions are:
- Branch
- Struct
- Property

Please see more information about these node types [here](/hierarchical_information_model/common_rule_set/node_types/).
