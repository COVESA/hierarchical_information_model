The `property` node type is used in both the `service` and `typedefinition` rule sets,
but as they differ slightly on the semantics in respective rule set it has a separate definition in each of the rule sets,
please see their definitions in the
[Service Rule Set:Property node node type](/hierarchical_information_model/service_rule_set/property) and the
[Type Definition Rule Set:Property node node type](/hierarchical_information_model/type_definition_rule_set/property)
respectively.
