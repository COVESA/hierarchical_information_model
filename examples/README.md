# HIM example files

This directory contains an example file of each of the information types that HIM currently defines:
- Resource data: HIM_Resource_example.v1.0.0.him
- Service data: HIM_Service.v1.0.0.him
- Type definition data: TypeDefinition_example.v1.0.0.him

It also contains an example file of a HIM configuration file: HIM_config_example.v1.0.0.him

The examples are expressed in YAML as it is the mandatory format for HIM files.
However, HIM does not prevent translation from original HIM files into other formats such as JSON, etc.

The examples do not make use of the neither the include nor the instances directives that HIM supports.
